- R is a dialect of S. S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell labs.
- S was initiated in 1976 as an internal statistical analysis environment - originally implemented as Fortran
libraries.
- The fundamentals of the S language has not really changed since 1998.

-- Features of R --
1. Syntax is very similar to S.
2. Runs on almost any standard computing platform/OS (even on PlayStation 3)
3. Frequent releases (annual + bugfix releases); active development
4. Graphic capabilities very sophisticated and better than most stat packages.
5. Quite lean, as far as software goes; functionality is divided into modular packages.


-- Drawbacks of R --
1. functionality is based on consumer demands, basically user contributions. If no feels like implementing your favorite method, then it's your job!
   - (or you need to pay someone to do it.)



-- R console input and Evaluation --
At the R prompt we type expressions. The <- symbol is the assignment operator.
The # character indicates a comment. Anything to the right of the # (including the # itself) is ignored.


> x <- 5
> x
[1] 5

The [1] indicates that x is a vector and 5 is the first element.

-- Printing --
> x <- 1:20 # Creates a sequence from 1 to 20
> x
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
[16] 16 17 18 19 20

The : operator is used to create integer sequences.
